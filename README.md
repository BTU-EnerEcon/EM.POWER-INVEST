Functionality
=============

EM.POWER INVEST can compute the cost minimal investment and dispatch in conventional generation capacity, which follows future exogenous potentials for renewable utilities and storage systems. It incorporates techniques for reducing regional and temporal resolution in favour of increasing technical properties; while facilitating the cost effective evolution of the European power system.
